</br>
Gas report generated by `forge test` is inflated as it also accounts for gas associated with constructing the userOp. </br>
Value of `gasleft()` is cached before sending the UserOp to EntryPoint and used just after the operation and consoled logged out. </br>

Run the following commands : </br>

```
forge install
forge test -vv
```
